# NestedRP
Nested Representative Points D_1\subseteq D_2\subseteq D_K  n_k is the number of points in D_k,  k=1,...,K

## nested_oneshot.R 
Generate a representative point set with a nested structure simultaneously based on the hybrid nested energy distance

## nestedseqbasic.R and nested_seq.R
nested_seq.R can sequentially generate a representative point set with a nested structure based on nested energy distance decomposition theory

## nestedsp_seq.R
nestedsp_seq.R can sequentially generate a representative point set with a nested structure based on R package "support".
